## Pigpay
Welcome to Pigpay, a comprehensive web application for managing key performance indicators (KPIs), products, and transactions. In this project, we're using a combination of technologies to create a full-fledged web application.

## Technologies Used
In this project, we are utilizing the following technologies:

<li> Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.</li>
<li>Express: A web application framework for building robust and scalable servers.</li>
<li>MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.</li>
<li>React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
<li>Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state.</li>
<li>Redux Toolkit: An official package for efficient Redux development.</li>
<li>TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript for client-side development.</li>


## Project Overview
Pigpay aims to be a web application for managing key performance indicators (KPIs), products, and transactions. The technology stack includes Node.js for the backend and the Express framework for creating a robust and scalable server.

With the assistance of Mongoose, we've configured data models representing key metrics such as revenue, expenses, and transactions. This enables us to maintain an organized and up-to-date record of relevant financial figures. Additionally, we've implemented routes for accessing and manipulating this data through a RESTful API.

On the client side, we've used React and Redux Toolkit to create a modern and interactive user interface. We've also incorporated Recharts to generate engaging charts, making it easier to visualize financial data.

One of the project's highlights is the ability to forecast future revenue using linear regression analysis. This empowers us to make more informed decisions by anticipating trends and potential scenarios.
